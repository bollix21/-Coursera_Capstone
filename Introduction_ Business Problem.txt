1. Introduction:         Business Problem

Road traffic accidents are responsible for millions of deaths and injuries every year in the world. Road traffic injuries cause significant economic losses from medical treatment cost to productivity loss and it costs most countries 3% of their gross domestic product [1]. The World Health Organization describes the road traffic system as the most complex and the most dangerous system with which people have to deal every day [2].
To reduce traffic accidents is an important public safety challenge and big data analytics has emerged with powerful techniques to provide insights on factors leading to the increased risk of accidents. Therefore, it can be used for the public to be more aware of potential accident risks when planning trips like locations which are susceptible for accident occurrence and to avoid dangerous driving behavior like drunk driving or speeding. Moreover, it can be used to develop public traffic prevention operations and policies to reduce overall accidents.
